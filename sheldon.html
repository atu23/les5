   <div class="class1"> <b>Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper:</b> Originally from Galveston, Texas, Sheldon was a child prodigy with an eidetic memory who began college at the age of eleven, and earned a PhD at age sixteen. He is a theoretical physicist researching quantum mechanics and string theory, and despite his IQ of 187, he finds many routine aspects of social situations difficult to grasp. He is determined to have his own way, continually boasts of his intelligence, and he has an extremely ritualized way of living. Despite these quirks, he begins a relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler.</div>

   <div class="class1">There is a sitcom "Young Sheldon" about his childhood. </div>
